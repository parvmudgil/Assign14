q1
Big data can be described by the following characteristics
Volume-The quantity of generated and stored data. The size of the data determines the value and potential insight-
      and whether it can actually be considered big data or not.
Variety-The type and nature of the data. This helps people who analyze it to effectively use the resulting insight.
Velocity-In this context, the speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges
        that lie in the path of growth and development.
Variability-Inconsistency of the data set can hamper processes to handle and manage it.
Veracity-The quality of captured data can vary greatly, affecting accurate analysis


q2
 Possible solutions to handle Big data
 Scaling , vertical and horizontal..
 1) Vertical - increasing the capacity of a single machine . For eg Storage, RAM , and processing poweer
 2) Horizontal - Using multiple machines in parallel , which is easier , cheaper , practical , time efficient .
 
 
 q3
  differences between scaling up and scaling out.
  Scale-up can solve a capacity problem without adding infrastructure elements such as network connectivity. However, it does
  require additional space, power, and cooling. Scaling up does not add controller capabilities to handle additional host activities
  . That means it doesn’t add costs for extra control functions either.
So the costs have not scaled at the same rate for the initial storage system plus storage devices – only additional devices have
been added.

Scale-out storage usually requires additional storage (called nodes) to add capacity and performance. Or in the case of monolithic
storage systems, it scales by adding more functional elements (usually controller cards).One difference between scaling out and
just putting more storage systems on the floor is that scale-out storage continues to be represented as a single system.
